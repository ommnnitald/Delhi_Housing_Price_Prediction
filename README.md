# Delhi_Housing_Price_Prediction
Content

This is not a comprehensive list, some of the attributes i left intentionally and some just couldn't extract. Dataset consists of 12 columns and 1259 rows. 6 of the features are numerical valued and rest are categorical. code for extracting Data is available at my Github account.

The Data has been extracted from MagicBricks (a website, provides common platform to property buyer and seller ).
Inspiration

I have done property price prediction on Boston Dataset, so i was wondering, if i can do it for Delhi properties too.
